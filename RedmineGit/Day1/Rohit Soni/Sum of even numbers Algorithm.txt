Step 1: Start
Step 2: Take input range from user upto which they want sum of even Numbers
Step 3: initialize 2 variables i = 0 and sum = 0
Step 4: initialize for loop as i = 0 to i = Range
Step 5: if condition as if i % 2 == 0 then
Step 6: Calculate Sum = Sum + i 
Step 7: else i ++
Step 8: then i = Range
Step 9: print Sum 
Step 10: End
